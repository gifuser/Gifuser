# Overview

**Gifuser** is a minimalist gif sharing application. This tool allows the user to record screen
and save the resulting video in a gif. Thus, one can share it with friends and,
due the wide spread adoption of gifs, everyone will be able to play the video either
in a web browser or locally.

Thanks to the upload facilities found in Gifuser, the user can upload gifs to file
sharing services once the stop button is clicked. Once the upload is finished,
the web link is stored on the clipboard to ease the process to share it with friends.

# Building from Sources

If you plan to build from sources,
first you will need to build the project [LibGifuser](https://github.com/gifuser/LibGifuser).
After you have successfully built the libraries from the LibGifuser repository,
you have to:

1. Download the sources from this repository and extract it somewhere
2. Inside the Gifuser solution folder, create a directory named *Libraries*
    * **Remark**: Casing is important, so the name must be exactly **Libraries**
3. Copy all files generated by the build of LibGifuser repository inside this *Libraries* folder
    * **Remark**: LibGifuser output files usually inside _LibGifuser\Debug_ or _LibGifuser\Release_ folders, depending on your configuration
4. Build the solution file Gifuser.sln
    * Linux
		* Issue the command

			```
			xbuild Gifuser.sln /p:Configuration=Release
			```
	* Windows
		* Use Visual Studio to open Gifuser.sln and build it with Release configuration
5. The resulting application and the files it depends will be found in *Gifuser/bin/Release*
6. Enjoy it!
